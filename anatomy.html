  <h1>Gross Anatomy and Boundaries</h1>

  <section>
    <h2>Location</h2>
    <p>The occipital lobe is situated at the posterior end of each cerebral hemisphere, forming the visual processing hub of the brain.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>External Landmarks</h2>
    <p>It is bounded anteriorly by the parieto‑occipital sulcus and laterally by the occipital notch. The lobe’s surface is marked by the calcarine sulcus, which houses the primary visual cortex.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Major Gyri and Sulci</h2>
    <p>The cuneus and lingual gyrus are prominent structures on the medial surface, flanking the calcarine sulcus. Lateral occipital gyri contribute to higher‑order visual processing.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Boundaries with Other Lobes</h2>
    <p>The occipital lobe interfaces with the parietal lobe superiorly and the temporal lobe laterally. These boundaries are functional as well as anatomical, reflecting integration of visual information with spatial and auditory processing.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Functional Correlates</h2>
    <p>Gross anatomy aligns with function: the calcarine sulcus corresponds to V1, while surrounding gyri host secondary visual areas. These structures together form the cortical foundation for vision.</p>
